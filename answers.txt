1. Why does this assignment ask you to create a function for messages but an action for sending the SMS message? What's the difference? 
    In general, functions are used for tasks that only read data, not change it. Whereas, actions are used for tasks that do change the state.
    This means that functions are often used for GET HTTP requests and actions are used for POST and PUT HTTP requests. In our use case in this lab,
    retrieving messages is only reading data using a GET request so a function is what we used, but since sending an SMS message uses a POST request
    and changes data, we use an action.

2. Why did we introduce the secrets for the Twilio module by configuring the rule that uses the module, rather than configuring the module directly? 
    We don't want to configure the secrets in the module directly because that is an awful security practice. We don't want to include the secrets
    in any file that will be under source control. That's just an industry best practice.
